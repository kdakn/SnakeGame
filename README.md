This is the Snake game which is implemented on java by me and my 2 friends for the school assignment. 

In order to play the game you have to download all the files including images so, 
I recommend you to download it as a zip file and extract it to a folder in your computer and run it. Also,directly copying this repository to your own Github Desktop and open it easily via Visual Studio Code is another good option. 

You can control the snake with arrow keys and try to collect bitcoins.

While you continue collecting bitcoins some walls will appear. Avoid them otherwise you will lose. 

Also, after some checkpoint Snake's speed will increase and walls are going to be bigger.
