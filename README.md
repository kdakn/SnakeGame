This is the Snake game which is implemented on java by me and my 2 friends for the school assignment. 

In order to play the game you have to download all the files including images so, 
I recommend you to directly add this repository to your own Github Desktop and open it easily via Visual Studio Code and run it. 

You can control the snake with arrow keys and try to collect bitcoins.

While you continue collecting bitcoins some walls will appear. Avoid them otherwise you will lose. 

Also, after some checkpoint Snake's speed will increase and walls are going to be bigger.
